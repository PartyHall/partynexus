 * Mercure "alternate topic" 101:
 *
 * On an entity, the user have access to certain ones but not all
 * E.g. Event (The user only has access to the event he owns or is participant of)
 *
 * In this case we can use the "alternate topic" feature of Mercure:
 * The frontend subscribes to `/events/{id}` as if he had access to everything
 * but his JWT contains a `mercure.subscribe` entry with the topic `/users/{id}?topic=/events/{id}`
 * which means he does not strictly have access to `/events/{id}` but only the ones that
 * are sent with BOTH `/events/{id}` AND `/users/{id}?topic=/events/{id}`.
