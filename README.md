# PartyNexus

PartyNexus is a sync hub for PartyHall. Your appliance will automatically sync pictures taken to it and provide a neat interface to share it with the people that were at the event without relying on zip export file.

If you really don't want to setup one (Like if you don't have a server), you can set it up on your own computer. You'll just need to run it every time you want to sync, and you'll need to be on the same network as the PartyHall appliance.

## Getting started

PartyNexus is still in early development and not available to try out.

Note that is not compatible with any currently released PartyHall (which includes v0.74 to this day). It requires PartyHall 2.0 minimum which is a fully rewritten version of PartyHall.

## Roadmap

- The rewrite is going correctly. I now have a bit more knowledge with the new frontend stack I'm using so there will be a second-pass refacto to clean up the new code.
- Once everything feels fine, a documentation will be written.
- Unit tests will be fully rewritten at some point.
- Add linting (phpstan, phpcsfixer and biome), and make GH workflows that triggers on PR.

## License

Until I deem this software as "ready" and have a full release, consider this ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

It will be made in a source-available license that pretty much grants you the rights to use, modify and distribute the software as long as you do not make money from it at some point.
