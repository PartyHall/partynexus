# PartyNexus

PartyNexus is a sync hub for PartyHall. Your appliance will automatically sync pictures taken to it and provide a neat interface to share it with the people that were at the event without relying on zip export file.

If you really don't want to setup one (Like if you don't have a server), you can set it up on your own computer. You'll just need to run it every time you want to sync, and you'll need to be on the same network as the PartyHall appliance.

## Getting started

PartyNexus is still in early development and not available to try out.

Note that is not compatible with any currently released PartyHall (which includes v0.74 to this day). It requires PartyHall 2.0 minimum which is a fully rewritten version of PartyHall.
