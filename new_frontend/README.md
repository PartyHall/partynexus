# New Frontend

This is a remaster of the original frontend.

Built with my new wip stack: tanstack router, tanstack query, tailwind and zustand

## TODO

- I need to translate the error on the backend based on user's "Accept-Language" header.
- I also need to modify my customFetch to send the appropriate language header based on preferences.
- Make custom snackbar to theme them (THANKS NOTISTACK to do weird shit like that so that I cant just override your css)
- Accessibility stuff
- Make the appliance communicate with the backend (e.g. is it online, etc...)
