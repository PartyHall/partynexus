# Stuff to do in the following versions

1. Complete the new frontend
2. Backdrops should be assigned to a user (And the appliance should fetch user's backdrops only)
3. Ensure EventMaker have the correct permissions
4. UNIT TEST
5. At some point, handle datetime properly (which means, as soon as it is denormalized it should be in UTC and stored as is and the frontend should handle the conversion to local time).
